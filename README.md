# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Ensemble Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project implements and evaluates various machine learning models for credit card fraud detection, inspired by the paper  
**"Enhancing Credit Card Fraud Detection: An Ensemble Machine Learning Approach (2024)"**.  
The main goal is to compare baseline and ensemble models, and to analyze the impact of data balancing techniques (SMOTE and under-sampling) on model performance.
