# README for the dataset used in the ML-Final Project

## Dataset Information

This project utilizes a dataset that is crucial for training and evaluating the machine learning model. Below are the details regarding the dataset:

### Source
The dataset is sourced from [insert source here, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.]. It can be accessed at [insert link here].

### Structure
The dataset consists of the following files:
- `data_file.csv`: This is the main data file containing the features and target variable.
- `data_description.txt`: A text file that describes the features in the dataset, including data types and any relevant notes.

### Preprocessing Steps
Before using the dataset for training, the following preprocessing steps were applied:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values were handled by [insert method, e.g., imputation, removal].
2. **Normalization**: Features were normalized using [insert method, e.g., Min-Max scaling, Z-score normalization].
3. **Encoding**: Categorical variables were encoded using [insert method, e.g., one-hot encoding, label encoding].

Please refer to the `src/main.py` file for details on how the dataset is loaded and utilized in the model training process.
